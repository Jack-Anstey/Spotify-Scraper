Parents Just Don't Understand,D.J. Jazzy Jeff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[Intro]\nYou know parents are the same no matter time nor place\nThey don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes\nSo to you other kids all across the land\nThere's no need to argue, parents just don't understand\n[Verse 1]\nI remember one year\nMy mom took me school shopping\nIt was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister\nAll hopped in the car\nWe headed downtown to the Gallery Mall\nMy mom started bugging with the clothes she chose\nI didn't say nothing at first\nI just turned up my nose\nShe said, “What's wrong? This shirt cost $20”\nI said, “Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!”\nThe next half hour was the same old thing\nMy mother buying me clothes from 1963\nAnd then she lost her mind and did the ultimate\nI asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!\nI said, “Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep”\nShe said, “You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet”\nI said, “Mom, let's put these clothes back, please”\nShe said “No, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show”\nI said, “This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer\nMom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers\nBut if you don't want to I can live with that but\nYou gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks”\nShe wasn't moved - everything stayed the same\nInevitably the first day of school came\nI thought I could get over, I tried to play sick\nBut my mom said, “No, no way, uh-uh, forget it”\nThere was nothing I could do, I tried to relax\nI got dressed up in those ancient artifacts\nAnd when I walked into school, it was just as I thought\nThe kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought\nAnd those who weren't laughing still had a ball\nBecause they were pointing and whispering\nAs I walked down the hall\nI got home and told my Mom how my day went\nShe said, “If they were laughing you don't need them\n'Cause they're not good friends”\nFor the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom\nThat I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times\nSo to you all the kids all across the land\nThere's no need to argue\nParents just don't understand\n[Verse 2]\nOh-kay, here's the situation\nMy parents went away on a week's vacation and\nThey left the keys to the brand new Porsche\nWould they mind?\nUmm, well, of course not\nI'll just take it for a little spin\nAnd maybe show it off to a couple of friends\nI'll just cruise it around the neighborhood\nWell, maybe I shouldn't...\nYeah, of course, I should\nPay attention, here's the thick of the plot\nI pulled up to the corner at the end of my block\nThat's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking\nI picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking\nYou should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions\nI honked my horn just to get her attention\nShe said, “Was that for me?”\nI said, “Yeah”\nShe said, “Why?”\nI said, “Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy”\nShe said, “How do I know you're not sick?\nYou could be some deranged lunatic”\nI said, “C'mon, toots, my name is the Prince\nBesides, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?\n”\nShe agreed and we were on our way\nShe was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word\nWe hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive\nWe ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes\nShe kicked her shoes off onto the floor\nShe said, “Drive fast, speed turns me on”\nShe put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas\nWe almost got whiplash, I took off so fast\nThe sunroof was open, the music was high\nAnd this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh\nShe had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far\nI guess that's why I didn't notice that police car\nWe're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche\nAnd to make this long story short - short\nWhen the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell\nI said, “I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer”\nI almost had a heart attack that day\nCome to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway\nI was arrested, the car was impounded\nThere was no way for me to avoid being grounded\nMy parents had to come off from vacation to get me\nI'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me\nMy parents walked in\nI got my grip, I said, “Ah, Mom, Dad... how was your trip?”\nThey didn't speak - I said, “I want to plead my case”\nBut my father just shoved me in the car by my face\nThat was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived\nThey took turns - one would beat me while the other was driving\nI can't believe it, I just made a mistake\nWell parents are the same no matter time nor place\nSo to you other kids all across the land\nTake it from me, parents just don't understand"
