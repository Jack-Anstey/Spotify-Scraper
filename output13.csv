I got to walk it by myself\nIf ever I could have thought this man in black was soft and had any yellow up his back, I gave that notion up the day a lumberjack came in and it wasn't to pray.

He hit that Reverend like a kick of a mule and to my way of thinkin' it took a real fool to turn the other face to that lumber jack, but that's what he did, The Reverend Mr. Black. He stood like a rock, a man among men and he let that lumberjack hit him again, and then with a voice as quiet as could be, he cut him down like a big oak tree when he said:\nI gotta walk that lonesome valley.

You were so lovely my heart nearly broke;\nAnd I thought how much like Sleeping Beauty a little girl is. When I\nTuck you in at night I never know how old you'll be when you wake. One\nEvening you crawl on your dad's lap and throw your arms around his neck\nThe next morning you might be much too grown up for that sort of thing\nYou're so quickly approaching the awkward age, too young to drive the\nCar and yet too old to be carried in the house half asleep on daddy's\nShoulder. I have a secret that I've never told you, Sleeping Beauty\nYou're going on a very exciting trip. You'll travel from yesterday all\nThe way to tomorrow. It's a rapid journey and you'll travel light\nLeaving behind you measles, mumps, freckles, bumps, bubble gum and me\nI promise not to feel too hurt when you discover that the world is more\nImportant than your daddy's lap. Yesterday you were blue jeans and pig tails\nThe neighborhood's best tree climber. Tomorrow you'll be blue organdy and\nPony tails and you'll view the world from a loftier perch - a pair of high\nHeel shoes\nYesterday you could mend a doll's broken leg with a hug; tomorrow you'll\nBe able to break a young man's heart with a kiss. Humh! Humh! Yesterday you\nCould get lost one aisle away from me at a supermarket now I have to worry\nAbout losing you down another aisle to some strange young man. You see\nJust at the point where you're growing pains stop, mine begins. Yesterday\nYou were kind of a pain in the neck when you were around, tomorrow you'll\nBe an ache in my heart when your not\nTomorrow you'll lay aside your jump rope and tie up the telephone lines\nAnd that little boy that used to push you in the mud; well, he'll fight to\nSit out a dance with you. The clock is countin' the minutes for you and the\nSky upstairs is savin' its' brighest stars; - and the sun is waitin' with\nIts' shiniest day\nOh I, I can't expect you to live in a doll house forever. Sooner or later\nThe butterfly sheds it's cocoon and the smallest bird must try its wings\nBut when you grow up and out of my arms; when you finally get too big for my\nShirts, I'll still recall how you used to scatter dust and dolls and partially\nThrough every room in the house; but you spread sunshine too. The dust is\nSettled, your mom picked up the dolls; but the sunshine will always fill\nThe corners of our hearts"
