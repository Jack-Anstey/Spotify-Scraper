Helium could be used to put fires out. Since that disaster all airships have been filled with hydrogen.

Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen),Baz Luhrmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[Spoken: Lee Perry]\nLadies and Gentlemen of the class of '97:\nWear sunscreen. If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now\nEnjoy the power and beauty of your youth; or never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded. But trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are \nnot\n as fat as you imagine\nDon't worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing\nBubblegum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that\nNever crossed your worried mind; the kind that blindside you at 4 PM on some idle Tuesday\nDo one thing every day that scares you\nSing\nDon't be reckless with other people's hearts; don't put up with people who are reckless with yours\nFloss\nDon't waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself\nRemember the compliments you receive; forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how\nKeep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements\nStretch"
