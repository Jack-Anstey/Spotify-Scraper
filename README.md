# Spotify Scraper

This program takes an input of songs and artists and returns tons of interesting statistics about them and its lyrics.

## How This Works

Utilizing the Spotify API, an song artist pair get's the associated track ID, where Spotify hosts a ton of interesting statistics about tracks and Genius hosts the lyrics for said song artist pair. These values are then gathered and then manipulated so that they are dumped into a csv file, which can then be used for any purpose, including but not limited to data analysis.

## How To Use

Have a .csv in the same folder as this code entiled `input.csv` with the same columns labled `song` and `artist` respectively. Input your `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET` in `secrets.py`, and then run! A file `output.csv` will be created when finished that will contain tons of interesting information about the songs that you requested.
