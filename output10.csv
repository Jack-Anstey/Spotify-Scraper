Mama took us to church, and I was in the choir too, hey yeah I sang a little bit in Sunday school\nShe taught us the golden rules, the 10 commandments, and she said, “Son do onto others as you have them do onto you”, she said “Don’t steal” “Don’t rob” You know all the things good parents try to instil into their children\nWell you know I did a few little things like shoot hook, I guess every kid shoots hooky at least once\nAnd umm, she said “Stay out of trouble” You know when I was a teenager I didn’t break in, burglarize, or rob anybody\nI tried to work for what I got, you know, tried to be honest.  Didn’t commit no crimes or nothing, but you know I had to wait,  huh ’til I reached manhood to commit a crime, according to the court of love, if there is such a court\nBut you know….sometimes you’re forced into things like this, see sometimes Cupid can shoot his arrow so fast you can’t get out the way, you know?\nAnd you can fall and the more you, it’s like being in quicksand too, the more you wiggle the deeper you sink\nI’m not gonna take up too much of your time, you see I’m not very good with words and I had to tell you all of that, so I can really say what I got to say\nSee there is a lot of talk going around town that I’m on the make for John’s girl, “Ike’s on the make for John’s girl”.  I don’t mean to do anybody wrong because I wouldn’t want anybody to bother anything that belongs to me\nBut you see I’ve never seen anybody like you, I’ve never known anybody like you, and there’s some things you just can’t help.  At night I toss and turn, I try to keep it out my mind but you see….I find myself thinking about you\nI just can’t help it, and right now……"
