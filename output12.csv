wish someone would care\nDon't you think someone should care?\nAh, don't you need someone to care?\nSit down and think about yourself\n[Interlude]\nYes, baby, sit down and think about yourselves\nIn all of my travels from town to town\nCity to city and country to country\nI've had the opportunity to talk to a lot of ladies\nAnd I've discovered that we women do have a lot in common\nWe worry about the same things: men and money\nAnd we've also discovered that a man is a helluva thing\nI think I'll say that again: a man is a helluva thing\nAh, but we women are a helluva thing, too\nAnything you men can do, we manage to do it better\nYou know, as kids we all have our aspirations\nYou know, the things we wanna do when we grow up\nThe little boys having one-track minds, you know\nBut little girls are a little bit different\nWe wanted to grow up to be stewardesses, nurses, doctors, lawyers, and mothers\nNot necessarily with children, but that little fella, different story\nAll he wanted was he first car and his first piece\nAnd he knew if he could get that car, he know he gon' get that piece\nYeah, but, now that they've gotten older, nothing has changed\nBut we women call that two-timing\nJust remember, fellas, two can play that game\nAnd every time you men two-time, we women can three\nNow, there are some of you fellas who have to have your Wheaties\nYou must eat your Cheerios, and you must have your One-a-Day vitamin with iron\nThis is so you can go out and three-time\nWell, go right ahead, honey, go right ahead\nBecause every time you men three-time, we women can six\nAnd our back don't hurt when we get through\nFurthermore, honey, keep one thing in mind:\nYours is a non-profit item and ours is a profit-making item, haha\nYou know, ladies, I've also discovered that men are avid liars\nFurthermore, they do it with a smile on their face\nHow many times you went out, came home, and your man wasn't there?\nSooner or later, here he come, rising with the sun\nSmiling from ear to ear\nAnd when you ask him, ""Baby, where you been?""\nHe look at you grinning, saying, ""Oh, I've been out with the boys""\nI'd sure like to know what those boys look like to put a smile on his face like that\nHave our mouth stuck out to the back door\nBut I found the perfect solution to that problem:\nThe very next time that man does that\nYou meet him in the door with nothing on\nAnd have your clothes lying on the bed\nAnd just for a wee bit of color, have a rose in your teeth\nAnd when he comes in that door and looks at you standing there with nothing on\nAnd those clothes on the bed and that rose in your teeth\nHe won't know if that man just left or you were just coming in\nGuarantee he won't hang out again\nBut now ladies, I highly recommend that you do take a course in karate\n'Cause he might come in that door and decide to knock that rose out your teeth\nBut now I've also discovered something else about them fellas:\nThey don't know what they want\nYou'll hear 'em all sitting down rapping together, talking about, you know, sports and stuff like that\nBut you'll hear 'em always getting around to the subject of women\nYou'll hear one man not to be outdone, you know\nHe'll stand up real proud and say, ""Man, I love my women with big legs""\nNow, honestly, I don't know why 'cause that's the first thing they throw on each side\nThen you get that other fella, he's the one that likes his lady with big hips\nNow, that makes sense, because if he's a little bitty man, he's gotta have something to hang on to\nNow, you get that other fella, he's the one that likes that lady with long hair\nSomething flowing in the wind, something he can run his fingers through and hope like hell it doesn't come off\nWell, I'll tell you, honey, I don't know about him, because in all these years, other than that I bought, I ain't never had long hair\nBut I'll tell you something else, in all these years, I ain't never had a man that asked me for hair yet\nThen you get that next fella, he's the one that never got weaned\nHe loves 'em large, loves to be smothered\nYou know, you take him and kinda lay him upside his ears\nAnd then you take one and you slap 'cross the nose with it\nMm, they call him ""The Titty Man""\nWell, all I got to say to him is this\nGirls, those of us who are not so well endowed, don't you dare get upset\nBecause I was told that anything over a mouthful, it's a waste anyhow"
