There'll be no more crying this time\nLiving on the edge. Running with the wind\nSoaring to the heights on an eagle's wing\nIt's time to go down to Mexico\nMescalitos' song will help you to be strong\nSo come on move on down the highway\nHead on down the road leaving it all behind\nHad enough of lying.
